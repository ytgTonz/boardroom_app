✅ Database performance optimized

NOTES
=====
- Calendar foundation (Phase 1) is solid and production-ready
- Phase 2 development BLOCKED until production issues resolved
- Focus on security, testing, and monitoring before feature development
- Calendar errors in CalendarView.tsx need investigation
- DevOps mentor recommendations prioritize stability over features

DEVOPS RECOMMENDATION
====================
"Feature development should be paused until production readiness 
criteria are met. A solid, secure foundation is essential before 
adding complex calendar features." - Production Assessment 2025-08-04
