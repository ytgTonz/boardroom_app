# DevOps Hybrid Approach Setup 🚀

This document outlines the hybrid DevOps approach implemented for the BoardroomBookingApp project.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our hybrid approach combines:
- **Manual commits** for logical changesets (better for code review)
- **Git hooks** for automatic formatting/linting
- **File watcher** for development auto-commits
- **CI/CD triggers** for automated testing/deployment

## 🔧 Components

### 1. Git Hooks (.git/hooks/pre-commit)
Automatically runs before each commit:
- ✅ Linting (if `npm run lint` exists)
- ✅ Type checking (if `npm run type-check` exists)
- ✅ Code formatting (if prettier is configured)
- ❌ Blocks commit if any checks fail

### 2. Development File Watcher (dev-watcher.js)
Monitors file changes and auto-commits:
- 👀 Watches `frontend/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`
- 👀 Watches `backend/**/*.{ts,js}`
- 👀 Watches `**/*.{json,md,yml,yaml}`
- ⏱️ 3-second batching delay
- 🚫 Ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `coverage`

### 3. NPM Scripts
- `npm run dev:watch` - Start file watcher only
- `npm run dev:full` - Start development servers + file watcher
- `npm run dev` - Start development servers only

## 🚦 Usage

### For Active Development with Auto-commits:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```
This will:
- Start backend and frontend development servers
- Monitor files for changes and auto-commit them

### For Manual Control:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Standard development without auto-commits.

### File Watcher Only:
```bash
npm run dev:watch
```
Just the file watcher for auto-commits.

## 📋 Best Practices

### Commit Message Format
All commits include the custom footer:
```
Committed by: ytgTonz
```

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Auto-commits for:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Quick fixes and iterations
- Development experiments
- Personal feature branches

**Use Manual commits for:**
- Feature completion
- Bug fixes for production
- Code ready for review
- Release preparation

## 🔒 Safety Features

1. **Pre-commit hooks** ensure code quality
2. **Batching delay** prevents spam commits
3. **Graceful shutdown** with Ctrl+C
4. **Error handling** for failed operations

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Slack/Teams notifications for commits
- [ ] Automatic branch creation for features
- [ ] Integration with Jira/GitHub issues
- [ ] Deployment automation triggers
- [ ] Code coverage tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### File Watcher Not Working
1. Check if chokidar is installed: `npm list chokidar`
2. Verify file permissions on dev-watcher.js
3. Check git status manually: `git status`

### Pre-commit Hook Failing
1. Make hook executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
2. Test linting manually: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
3. Check if scripts exist in package.json

### Auto-commits Not Happening
1. Verify files are being watched (check console output)
2. Ensure git is properly configured
3. Check for unstaged changes: `git status --porcelain`
