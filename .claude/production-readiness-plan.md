3. **Poor error handling** - Application may crash unexpectedly
4. **No monitoring** - Issues may go undetected

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Address security issues in Phase 1 (week 1)
2. Implement comprehensive testing in Phase 2
3. Add monitoring and alerting in Phase 3
4. Conduct thorough security audit before go-live
