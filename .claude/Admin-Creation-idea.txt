● Based on your current system, here are industry-standard
  approaches to make admin creation easier and smoother:

  Current System Analysis

  Your system already has:
  - ✅ Role-based system (admin/user roles)
  - ✅ CLI script (createAdmin.js)
  - ✅ Admin UI for user management
  - ✅ Role promotion/demotion via dropdown

  Recommended Improvements

  1. Super Admin Setup

  // Enhanced roles: 'super_admin', 'admin', 'user'
  // Only super_admins can create new admins

  2. Web-Based Admin Creation

  Add "Create New Admin" button in AdminUsers.tsx with form:
  - Name, Email, Temporary Password
  - Optional: Send welcome email with login instructions
  - Auto-generate secure temporary password

  3. CLI Enhancements

  # Interactive CLI
  node scripts/createAdmin.js --interactive

  # Command line args
  node scripts/createAdmin.js --email admin@company.com
  --name "John Doe"

  4. Invitation System

  - Send email invitations instead of direct creation
  - User clicks link → sets own password → becomes admin
  - More secure than preset passwords

  5. Bulk Admin Creation

  // CSV import for multiple admins
  // Useful for organization onboarding

  Immediate Quick Win: Add a "Create Admin" form to your
  existing AdminUsers component since you already have the
  user management infrastructure.

  Would you like me to implement any of these approaches?
